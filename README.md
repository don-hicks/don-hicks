## 🚀 About Me

I'm an experienced full stack developer and technical project lead, specializing in the design and implementation of robust, modern web applications. My background spans SaaS, developer tools, and high-stakes systems support. I thrive at the intersection of clarity, collaboration, and practical delivery.

- 🏗️ **Organizer and systems thinker:** I turn complex visions into actionable roadmaps and working products.
- ⚙️ **Tech stack:** TypeScript, Next.js, Rust, WASM, PostgreSQL, Supabase, SVG, CI/CD on Vercel.
- 📈 **Focused on results:** My current work is dedicated to open-source visualization projects for higher-dimensional geometry (see [Shard³](https://github.com/hyxos/shard3) and [Slice³](https://github.com/hyxos/slice3)), designed for real-world value and demonstrable outcomes.
